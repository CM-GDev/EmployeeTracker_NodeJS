  ## Description
  
  - This is my first homework assignment using MySQL for the Full Stack Web Developer course I'm enrolled in. The assigment was to create a content management systems (CMS) interface using Inquirer.js so a business owner can view, manage, and organize the departments, roles, and employees of his/her company.
  - By completing this assignment, I was able to implement lessons from my course, including:
    - Code JavaScript for a Node.js application,
    - Utilize several npm packages
    - Work with MySQL to create and manipulate a database
    - Establish Javascript modules to deploy the application
    - Run asynchronous queries
    - And finally use Inquirer.js for the user interface on the command-line.
  - See the Usage Information of this README for a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates the appication's functionality.
  
  The following are screenshots of the final version of the application in the terminal and a sample HTML page generated by the command-line application.
